# social-links-profile-ii
As a challenge by Frontend Mentor, I was tasked with recreating a simple social links profile that is responsive to both mobile and desktop screens!

This version for the challenge is a more personalized take, which you can view in browser through the link below. You can also see the original submission repo on my profile.
